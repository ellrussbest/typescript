# INITIALIZE FUNCTION

Here's an example of how to initialize `esbuild-wasm` in TypeScript:

```
import { initialize } from 'esbuild-wasm';

const initializeEsbuild = async (): Promise<void> => {
  await initialize({
    wasmURL: '/esbuild.wasm',
  });
};

initializeEsbuild();
```

Here are some of the other options that can be passed in the object within the `initialize` function:

- `worker`: A boolean value that indicates whether to use a web worker to run the `esbuild` service in a separate thread. This can improve performance by offloading the work to a separate thread, but may not be supported in all environments.

- `logLevel`: A string value that determines the level of logging that `esbuild` should use. Possible values are `"info"`, `"warning"`, `"error"`, and `"silent"`. The default value is `"warning"`.

- `fetch`: A function that is used to fetch the `esbuild.wasm` file. This can be useful if you need to customize the way that the file is fetched, for example if you need to add authentication headers or use a custom caching strategy.

- `workerOptions`: An object that contains options that are passed to the web worker. This can be useful if you need to customize the worker's behavior, for example if you need to set a maximum number of tasks that can be executed concurrently.

Here's an example of how you can pass in some of these options:

```
await initialize({
  wasmURL: '/esbuild.wasm',
  worker: true,
  logLevel: 'info',
  fetch: async (url: string) => {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      },
    });
    return response.arrayBuffer();
  },
  workerOptions: {
    maxTasks: 10,
  },
});
```

In this example, we pass in the `worker`, `logLevel`, `fetch`, and `workerOptions` options. We set `worker` to `true` to enable the use of a web worker, and set `logLevel` to `"info"` to increase the amount of logging output. We define a custom `fetch` function that adds an `Authorization` header to the request, and set `workerOptions` to `{ maxTasks: 10 }` to limit the number of tasks that can be executed concurrently.

## In Simple terms:

The `initialize` function is used to set up your `esbuild` environment. When you call this function, you can pass in an object with different options to customize how `esbuild` works.

Here are some of the options you can pass in:

- If you set `worker` to `true`, `esbuild` will use a separate thread to do its work. This can make it faster, but it might not work in all situations.

- `logLevel` determines how much information `esbuild` will print out while it's working. If you set `logLevel` to `"info"`, you'll see more detailed information.

- `fetch` is a way to get the `esbuild.wasm` file that `esbuild` needs to work. You can use this option to customize how `esbuild` gets this file.

- `workerOptions` lets you set some options for the web worker that `esbuild` uses. This can be useful if you want to limit the number of tasks that can be done at once.

You can use these options to customize how `esbuild` works for your specific needs.

# TRANSFORM FUNCTION
The `transform` function in `esbuild-wasm` allows you to transform code using `esbuild` without writing the code to disk. You can pass options to the `transform` function to customize how `esbuild` transforms your code.

Here are some of the options you can pass to the `transform` function:

- `loader`: This option specifies the type of file you're transforming. For example, if you're transforming a JavaScript file, you would set `loader` to `"js"`. 

- `sourcefile`: This option specifies the name of the file you're transforming. This is used to generate better error messages.

- `sourcemap`: This option determines whether `esbuild` generates a source map for the transformed code. A source map maps the transformed code back to the original code, which can be useful for debugging.

- `target`: This option specifies the version of JavaScript that `esbuild` should target. For example, if you set `target` to `"es2015"`, `esbuild` will transform your code to work in environments that support ES2015.

- `minify`: This option determines whether `esbuild` should minify the transformed code. Minification removes unnecessary characters from the code to make it smaller and faster to download.

- `jsxFactory`: This option specifies the name of the function that `esbuild` should use to create JSX elements. If you're using a library like React, you would set this to the name of the `React.createElement` function.

- `jsxFragment`: This option specifies the name of the function that `esbuild` should use to create JSX fragments. If you're using a library like React, you would set this to the name of the `React.Fragment` component.

You can use these options to customize how `esbuild` transforms your code.

Here's an example of how you can use the `transform` function with some options:

```
import * as esbuild from 'esbuild-wasm';

async function transformCode(code) {
  await esbuild.initialize();
  const result = await esbuild.transform(code, {
    loader: 'jsx',
    target: 'es2015',
    jsxFactory: 'React.createElement',
    jsxFragment: 'React.Fragment',
  });
  return result.code;
}

const code = `
  function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
`;

transformCode(code).then((result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
```
